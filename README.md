# LFG-Discord-Bot

Hello.

To run this project you'll need node / npm.

the root command for the bot is !lfg and !lfg help will list you the commands.

the commands that won't be listed are the ones relative to the Black Survival's Discord users (but you can try them if you feel
like it by changing your own name on the server by one listed or making a special rule for you). Also, saying "thank you lfg"
or "hello lfg" will make him react.

Please contact me for any questions or remarks regarding this bot.
