# LFG-Discord-Bot

Hello.

To run this project you'll need node / npm.

I created a small Discord server for you to test it quickly so once you have downloaded the project and installed the node
modules, start the bot with npm start or node index.js (because in all honesty i won't keep it running all day long)
and go to https://discord.gg/TsNWeWC where all the channels are already setup.

the root command for the bot is !lfg and !lfg help will list you the commands.

the commands that won't be listed are the ones relative to the Black Survival's Discord users (but you can try them if you feel
like it by changing your own name on the server by one listed or making a special rule for you). Also, saying "thank you lfg"
or "hello lfg" will make him react.

Please contact me for any questions or remarks regarding this bot.
